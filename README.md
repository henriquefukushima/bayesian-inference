- Professor: Luis Gustavo
- Student: Henrique Abe Fukushima

Solutions and simulations to problems of Bayesian Inference in a course of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME-USP).

The goal of this repository is to improve learning experience through visualization of bayesian posterior actualization and other computational simulations.

Problem sets and solutions can be found on the respective folders.
